# Word-Guess-Game

This word guess game is like hangman.

There is a word bank that will be chosen at random. That random word will determine the amount of guess or tries you get.
You will not take a hit for guessing the same letters or guessing non letters. When you win or lose, the game will restart and a new word will populate. 

This is my first attempt of a javascript game. Have fun, and feedback is welcomed.
